# Inventory_Management_System
Hey Christine, I based this off your example, I am sorry for the quality of my work,
I have been struggeling with this assignement, but Im still working on it and gradualy getting closer to a complete mvp. I now have Create read,update and delete, for one table. I am getting this project closer to being functional, It will just require more time and practice
