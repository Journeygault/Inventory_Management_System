# Inventory_Management_System
This is what I have so far, I still need to add Crud to 3 tables but its working for one. I was able to fix the date time issue. with a few more weeks of work I believe I can get this project to be a website I can really be proud of, Once I have Crud accross the board I will focus on building A feature for determining hop bitternes as well as a feature that can be used to get a visual representation of the color of beer a malt will provide (SRM).
