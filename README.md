# Inventory_Management_System
Hey Christine, I based this off your example, I am sorry for the quality of my work,
I have been struggeling with this assignement, but Im still working on it and gradualy getting closer to a complete mvp. I now have Create read, and delete, and im currently trying to fix my update.
I know we are suposed to have CRUD for all tables, but im just trying to get it to work for 1 before moving on the next table,
